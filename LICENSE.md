### IPSUSHADE LICENSE V1.0

I permit all users to use, modify and privately redistribute my work (the `.ini` preset files and my `MultiLut_Ipsusu.png` texture) with any version of ReShade or derivative fork.

It is also permitted to include my work in any bundled archives or distributions of projects that I have agreed to distribute my work though in the past (i.e, GShade).

However, please do contact me if you would like redistribute my work as part of a new project or publicly release any modified versions of my presets. 

It is highly unlikely that I would object to any proposal, I'd just like to be aware of how my work is being used and even offer my help where I can to make sure
any users will be experiencing the best versions of my work. 

The shaders used within this project have their own licenses, which you should refer to if dealing with these files outside of personal use.

The textures in this project are used in accordance with specific license agreements or with permission of their creators. Please contact me if you are looking at redistributing any of the texture files within this project (with the exception of my `MultiLut_Ipsusu.png`), and I will inform you of the specific licenses.
