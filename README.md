At the current time I am unsure about permission to redistribute the Marty Mcfly qUINT shader collection, which is used in my Questing, Screenie and Ultimate presets.

<h3 align="center">
While I wait for a response, you must download them from <a href='https://github.com/martymcmodding/qUINT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip' target='_black'>  - HERE - </a> and merge the <code>Shaders</code> folder with the one found inside your <code>reshade-shaders</code> or <code>gshade-shaders</code> folder after following the appropriate guide below.

## What is IpsuShade?

IpsuShade is a ReShade preset collection that aims to deliver both maximum quality at maximum FPS with the `Gameplay`, `GameplayLite` and `Questing` preset types, but also with high fidelity screenshot preset types such as `Screenie` and `Ultimate`.

Each preset type comes in a range of 7 included colour types.
These colours are:

## How do I use the Ipsusu Presets on a fresh ReShade install?

<h3 align="center"> <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipsusu/IpsuShade/master/IpsuShade_ReShadeFolderRelease.zip' target='_blank'> Click here to download IpsuShade files for a fresh ReShade install. </a> </h3>

When installing to a fresh ReShade install, simply drag and drop the folders included in the .zip file downloaded by clicking the link above into your FFXIV installation directory and merge / overwrite the existing `reshade-presets` and `reshade-shaders` folders. 

For the Steam version, this is most likely: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY XIV Online\game\`

For the Windows version, this is most likely: `C:\Program Files (x86)\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\game\`

### Note: The existing folders should be named `reshade-presets` and `reshade-shaders`. If they are called `gshade-presets` and `gshade-shaders` please read the section below as you have an installation that has been migrated from a GShade install.

<h3> TEMPORARY DISCLAIMER STEP: Make sure you also install the qUINT shaders from <a href='https://github.com/martymcmodding/qUINT/archive/refs/heads/master.zip' target='_black'>  - HERE - </a> and drag + merge the <code>Shaders</code> folder into your <code>reshade-shaders</code> folder </h3>

Once in-game, open the ReShade overlay (by pressing the `Home` key by default) and navigate to the `Ipsusu` folder inside your `reshade-presets` folder.

Simply double click any of the `.ini` presets to enable them. Click the two dots at the top (the "..") to go back to the main folder if you would like to swap to another creator's preset (if you have any installed).


## How do I use the Ipsusu Presets if I migrated from a GShade install?

The Ipsusu presets were originally (and, technically currently) included with a GShade install. 

As such, <i>you should already have the presets</i> and you will be able to find them in the <b>gshade-presets\Ipsusu\ </b> folder (just scroll down a bit and click the "Ipsusu" folder). Simply double click any of the .ini presets to enable them. 

Click the two dots at the top (the "..") to go back to the main folder if you would like to swap to another creator's preset.

<h3>At the time of writing (2023-02-07), my <code>Screenie</code> and <code>Ultimate</code> presets have been updated from the included GShade release. </h3>

Due to the current state of GShade, you must manually update these by downloading the folder below and overwriting these presets in your `gshade-presets\Ipsusu` folder. You should not need to update the `gshade-shaders` but there is no harm in this as they are the exact same versions as included.
